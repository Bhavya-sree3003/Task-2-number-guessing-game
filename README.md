# Task-2-number-guessing-game
Here's a preview of how the Number Guessing Game would play out when you run the script:
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I have selected a number between 1 and 100. Can you guess it?

The player enters a guess, and the program responds:
Enter your guess: 50
Too low! Try again.

The player continues guessing:
Enter your guess: 75
Too high! Try again.

This process repeats until the player correctly guesses the number:
Enter your guess: 68
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 5 attempts.

The game dynamically adjusts the hints based on the player's input, making it engaging and interactive.
